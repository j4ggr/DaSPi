# User Guide

Welcome to the DaSPi User Guide! This section provides comprehensive guidance on using DaSPi for data analysis, statistical process improvement, and quality engineering.

## 3S Methodology

The **3S Methodology** is a systematic problem-solving approach that combines the best practices from Six Sigma DMAIC and 8D methodologies. It provides a structured framework for identifying, analyzing, and solving quality problems.

### [3S Methodology Overview](3s-methodology.md)

Learn about the complete 3S methodology, its phases, and how it integrates with existing quality frameworks.

### [Specify Phase](3s-specify.md)

The first phase focuses on **defining and containing** the problem:

- Team formation and project charter
- Problem definition and impact assessment  
- SIPOC analysis and process mapping
- Immediate containment strategies
- Validation and measurement systems

### [Scrutinize Phase](3s-scrutinize.md)

The second phase concentrates on **investigating and analyzing** root causes:

- Root cause analysis techniques
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Design of Experiments (DOE)
- Correlation and regression analysis
- Multivariate analysis methods

### [Stabilize Phase](3s-stabilize.md)

The final phase emphasizes **implementing and controlling** sustainable solutions:

- Solution selection and optimization
- Implementation and validation
- Control systems and monitoring
- Knowledge transfer and project closure

## Statistical Methods
