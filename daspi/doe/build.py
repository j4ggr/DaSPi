        -----
        Statistically correct block assignment is performed by

        (block generator). For each run, the value of the block 
        generator (the product of the coded levels of the specified 
        factors) is computed, and unique values are mapped to block 
        numbers. If `blocks` is 'highest', the highest-order interaction 
        (all factors) is used. This ensures that block effects are 
        orthogonal to main effects and lower-order interactions when 
        using a confounding generator, as recommended in DOE literature 
        (see Montgomery, 2017). If `blocks` is a str or List[str], the
        specified interaction is used. If `blocks` is 'replica', blocks
        are assigned by replicate. If `blocks` is an int, blocks are
        assigned evenly (not statistically confounded).

class FractionalFactorialDesignBuilder(BaseDesignBuilder):
    """
    Builder for 2-level fractional factorial designs with optional 
    foldover.


    This class supports the construction of regular 2-level fractional 
    factorial designs using generator strings (e.g., 'C=AB'), and can 
    optionally add a foldover to the design.

    Default generators for common designs (see also 
    get_default_generators):

    | Design      | Basic Factors | Generators                | Example Generator Strings   |
    |-------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | 2^(3-1)     | A, B          | C = AB                    | ['C=AB']                    |
    | 2^(4-1)     | A, B, C       | D = ABC                   | ['D=ABC']                   |
    | 2^(5-2)     | A, B, C       | D = AB, E = AC            | ['D=AB', 'E=AC']            |
    | 2^(6-3)     | A, B, C       | D = AB, E = AC, F = BC    | ['D=AB', 'E=AC', 'F=BC']    |
    | 2^(7-3)     | A, B, C, D    | E = ABC, F = ABD, G = BCD | ['E=ABC', 'F=ABD', 'G=BCD'] |


    Parameters
    ----------
    factors : Iterable[Factor]
        Factors defining the design space. All factors must have exactly 
        2 levels.
    generators : List[str]
        List of generator strings that define how dependent factors are 
        constructed from basic factors. For example, if you have 4 
        factors A, B, C, and D, you can set generators to 
        ['C=AB', 'D=BC']. This means that factor C is defined as the 
        product of factors A and B (C = A * B), and factor D as the 
        product of B and C (D = B * C). The order of the generator 
        strings should match the order of the dependent factors in the 
        factors list. For common designs, see the table above or use 
        get_default_generators(k, p).
    fold : bool | str, optional
        Whether to add a foldover. If True, a foldover will be added for 
        all factors. If a string is provided, it should be the name of 
        the factor to fold over. Default is False (no foldover).
    replicates : int, optional
        Number of replicates. Must be positive, by default 1.
    central_points : int, optional
        Number of central points to be added to each block. These are
        used to test linear effects. Must be non-negative. If set to 0,
        no central points are added. by default 0.
    blocks : int, optional
        Number of blocks. Must be positive, by default 1.
    shuffle : bool, optional
        Whether to shuffle the design, by default True.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a 2^(3-1) fractional factorial design (3 factors, 1 generator):

    ```python
    from daspi.doe.build import Factor, FractionalFactorialDesignBuilder

    fA = Factor('A', (-1, 1))
    fB = Factor('B', (-1, 1))
    fC = Factor('C', (-1, 1))
    builder = FractionalFactorialDesignBuilder(fA, fB, fC, generators=['C=AB'])
    df = builder.build_design(corrected=False)
    print(df)
    ```

    ```console
       std_order  run_order  central_point  replica  block  A  B  C
    0          0          0              1        1      1 -1 -1  1
    1          1          1              1        1      1 -1  1 -1
    2          2          2              1        1      1  1 -1 -1
    3          3          3              1        1      1  1  1  1
    ```

    Create the same design with foldover (doubles the number of runs, reverses A):

    ```python
    builder = FractionalFactorialDesignBuilder(fA, fB, fC, generators=['C=AB'], fold=True)
    df = builder.build_design(corrected=False)
    print(df)
    ```

    ```console
       std_order  run_order  central_point  replica  block  A  B  C
    0          0          0              1        1      1 -1 -1  1
    1          1          1              1        1      1 -1  1 -1
    2          2          2              1        1      1  1 -1 -1
    3          3          3              1        1      1  1  1  1
    4          4          4              1        1      1  1 -1 -1
    5          5          5              1        1      1  1  1  1
    6          6          6              1        1      1 -1 -1  1
    7          7          7              1        1      1 -1  1 -1
    ```

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the parameters are invalid:
        - All factors must have exactly 2 levels.
        - Number of replicates must be positive.
        - Number of central points must be non-negative.
        - Number of blocks must be positive.
        - Generators must be provided as a list of strings.
        - Generators must match the number of dependent factors.
        - Each generator string must be in the format 'C=AB' where C is 
          the dependent factor and AB are the independent factors.
        - Each dependent factor must be defined in the generators.
        - The first basic factor must be reversed in sign for foldover.

    Notes
    -----
    In fractional factorial designs, only a subset of all possible 
    factor combinations is run, which leads to confounding (aliasing) 
    between main effects and interactions. Foldover is a technique to 
    resolve some of these confoundings by running an additional set of 
    experiments where the sign of one or more basic factors is reversed. 
    This effectively doubles the number of runs and allows for the 
    separation of certain effects that were aliased in the original 
    fraction. Foldover is especially useful for identifying main effects 
    that may be confounded with two-factor interactions in the initial 
    design.
    Key points:
        - Foldover is meaningful only for regular 2-level fractional
          factorial designs, not for full factorials, non-regular
          designs, or designs with more than two levels per factor.
        - For full factorial designs, foldover is unnecessary because
          there is no aliasing to resolve.
        - For non-regular or mixed-level designs, the concept of
          foldover does not apply in the classical sense.
